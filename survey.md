## Short Survey
Please answer following questions below:

1. Are you comfortable leading a team of Frontend Engineers? Helping them to become better versions of themselves and making sure that common coding practices are applied?
- [ ] Yes
- [X] No (But I am willing to get into such roles).

2. How do you ensure code quality and consistency when working with a team of junior developers?
<textarea name="codeQuality" rows="6" cols="50">
I mostly followed code review step during agile methodologies in career therefore, code review is one of the main step that really helps to write consistent code. However, I also use tools such as prettier, eslint which I also used in this technical assignment. Moreover, having a particular style guide and documentation to follow while writing code is something also came in handy with me in the past.

3. How do you balance the need for delivering features quickly with the need for maintainable, scalable code?
<textarea name="balanceFeatures" rows="6" cols="50">
This really depends on the my employers culture and implementation process. Most of the time I worked in teams which usually had their own component, utility based libraries. The rest of the team's job is to reuse them which makes it convenient to write maintainable and scalable code. For implementing such libraries, I haven't seen such strict deadlines for implementing such reusable libraries as such projects are internal projects and the management teams were usually willing for extensions.

4. How do you approach making technical decisions on a project, and what factors do you consider?
<textarea name="technicalDecisions" rows="6" cols="50">
After reading through this technical assignment I came to know that I need to implement components that are reusable. Therefore, I made use of yarn to build `confirmation` component and add it as a dependency to `questionnaire` project and reused it there.

For production level project, I would have to get as much information about the project and do my own research about the tech stack and find the potential more technical components and packages that could code more time and effort and try bring in either third party solutions(if allowed) or write my own.

5. How do you ensure that your team follows best practices for accessibility and browser compatibility?
<textarea name="bestPractices" rows="6" cols="50">
My recent projects hardly had requirements regarding both of these concepts however, modern browsers are usually are most of the time up to date for most of the resent features. caniuse.com is one place where I would check for compatibilities area. In the past I used modernizr for this.

Using aria labels are one of the area that I can think of and there are several tools and npm packages available that allows us to embed into development environment and do checks regarding accessibility.
